## ImageAcquisition
Setup image acquisition parameters for TriSpectorP
### Description
This sample includes a UI for viewing heightmaps and 2D sensor data from a
TriSpectorP device, as well as controls for configuring image acquisition
parameters.
### How to Run
Starting this sample is possible either by running the App (F5) or
debugging (F7+F10). Setting a breakpoint on the first row inside the 'main'
function allows debugging step-by-step after the 'Engine.OnStarted' event.
Image acquisition parameters can be configured in the UI on the DevicePage.
You need to be connected to a TriSpectorP, this App does not work with the
emulator.
